**Cost-Volume-Profit Analyses using Tableau** \
I developed a case that showcases the step-by-step process of performing data visualizations for a fictitious ride-hailing company, Ubor Technologies, using [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/academic/students). This case equips students with the necessary skills to analyze a company's sales and cost data, enabling them to make informed decisions based on insights derived from the data visualizations.
You can find the case [here](https://stacey-choy.github.io/files/UPLOAD Ubor Technologies Case Instruction.pdf).
