A growing number of companies have voluntarily developed and disclosed pre-earnings announcement quiet period policies. During quiet periods, companies restrict private communications with the investment community to prevent the selective disclosure of quarterly results. The details of quiet periods vary considerably across firms, potentially creating important variations in the private information shared with select parties. Using hand-collected data, this study examines determinants of quiet periods and their consequences on price discovery patterns and information asymmetry among investors. I find that firms (i) are more likely to adopt quiet periods when they face higher litigation risks and (ii) less likely to do so when they face higher investor demands for private access or when managers can profit from inside information leaks. Next, I show that quiet periods are associated with (i) increased investor reactions to earnings news by reducing the anticipatory price run-up before announcements and (ii) reduced information asymmetry among investors, consistent with a more level information playing field without selective disclosures. However, these patterns manifest only in the presence of effective SEC monitoring, which increases the credibility of voluntary quiet period commitments by making it costly for managers to deviate from their policies. In light of the increasing evidence of pervasive selective disclosures, these findings have policy implications. -->

<!--  - This paper examines whether and how public environmental enforcement affects private lenders’ monitoring efforts and the effectiveness of such monitoring. We capture lender monitoring using environmental covenants in loan agreements. Consistent with the prediction that stringent public environmental enforcement increases lenders’ monitoring incentives, we find that in the presence of higher environmental regulatory enforcement intensity, lenders are more likely to use environmental covenants when lending to polluting borrowers and when the loans are secured by real property collateral. Moreover, consistent with the prediction that stringent public environmental enforcement facilitates lender monitoring, we find that environmental covenants are more effective in reducing borrowers’ toxic chemical releases when environmental regulatory enforcement is stronger. Taken together, our findings corroborate the importance of public environmental enforcement in inducing lenders’ monitoring efforts, as well as the joint role of public enforcement and private lender monitoring in curbing corporate pollution. -->

<!--  - This study constructs a novel measure that aims to capture face-to-face private communications between firm managers and sell-side analysts by mapping detailed, large-volume taxi trip records from New York City to the GPS coordinates of companies and brokerages. Consistent with earnings releases prompting the need for private communications, we observe daily taxi ride volumes between companies and brokerages increase around earnings announcement dates (EAD). We find that the increase in ride volumes following EAD is negatively associated with analysts’ earnings forecast errors, with a more pronounced association when earnings announcements are bundled with more public disclosures. In contrast, the increase in ride volumes before EAD explains analysts’ downward adjustment of near-term earnings forecasts to create small positive earnings surprises. Taken together, our results suggest that analysts may learn different information depending on the timing and context of in-person meetings, which help them convey the company’s message to the investment community.-->

**(3) Out-of-Court Public Debt Restructuring and Debtholder-focused Investor Communication**
(with Christine Liu and Dushyantkumar Vyas)
<!--  - We study how debtholder-focused investor communication activities impact public debt restructuring outcomes for financially distressed firms. Public debt tender and exchange offers are often an integral part of the restructuring of financially distressed firms. However, the success of such restructurings involves garnering consensus from a group of dispersed bondholders. We argue that focused debt-related investor communication activities (hereafter, “Debt IC”) play a pivotal role in reducing coordination frictions in the restructuring process. We find that Debt IC activities are positively associated with the likelihood of undergoing public debt restructuring over inaction or pursuing a costly Chapter 11 bankruptcy process. In addition, Debt IC activities can aid distressed borrowers in promoting participation in the proposed offers and achieving favorable restructured credit terms such as reductions in coupon rates. Cross-sectional analyses suggest that Debt IC is particularly effective in the presence of coordination frictions and information asymmetry. Furthermore, survival analysis provides modest evidence that Debt IC contributes positively to sustainable restructuring. Overall, these findings highlight the influential role of Debt IC activities in enhancing the effectiveness of restructuring efforts for financially distressed firms.-->
